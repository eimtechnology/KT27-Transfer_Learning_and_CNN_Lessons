    "- Gradients became **too small** in early layers\n",
    "- Training got **stuck** and performance actually got **worse**\n",

    "### ✨ The ResNet Breakthrough (2015)\n",
    "- **Residual connections**: Skip paths that bypass layers\n",
    "- **Identity shortcuts**: Allow gradients to flow directly\n",
    "- **Deep networks that actually work**: 152+ layers became possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 ResNet18 Specifications:\n",
    "- **18 layers deep** (perfect for learning)\n",
    "- **11.7M parameters** (manageable size)\n",
    "- **224×224 input** (industry standard)\n",
    "- **Pre-trained on ImageNet** (1.2M images, 1000 classes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💪 What Makes It Special:\n",
    "- **Residual Blocks**: `x + F(x)` instead of just `F(x)`\n",
    "- **Batch Normalization**: Stable and fast training\n",
    "- **Global Average Pooling**: No overfitting from fully connected layers\n",
    "- **Transfer Learning Ready**: Perfect feature representations\n",
